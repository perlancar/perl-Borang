# ABSTRACT: Function-oriented form framework

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<EARLY RELEASE, WORK IN PROGRESS, MANY THINGS ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED>.

Borang is a function-oriented form framework. Borang can generate forms using
information from L<Rinci> function metadata. After you fill out and submit a
form, the form submission will be converted into function arguments and sent to
the function via function call.

Borang is environment-agnostic: it can target HTML forms as well as CLI/CUI/GUI.
