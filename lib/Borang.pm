# ABSTRACT: Rinci-based form framework

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WORK IN PROGRESS, SOME THINGS ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED>.

Borang is a form framework that is function-oriented (and not object-oriented,
on purpose). In Borang, form submission is eventually sent to a function and
vice versa form is generated from L<Rinci> function metadata.

Borang is environment-agnostic (can generate HTML forms as well as CLI/CUI/GUI).
