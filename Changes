        - First release with some things implemented: HTML generation for some
          simple metadata (int/float/num/str/bool arguments), some examples.


0.01    2013-11-12 (SHARYANTO)

	- No functional changes. Rebuild to fix t/00-compile.t generated by
	  older DZP::Test::Compile (2.019 < x < 2.033).


0.00    2013-10-03 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release, empty (renamed from ReForm because the naming conflict
          with a pragma module called 'reform').
